## Hooks

### useAuth

The `useAuth` hook provides authentication functionality throughout the application. It allows components to access the current user's information and perform login, logout, and registration operations.

### useApi

The `useApi` hook provides a simple interface for interacting with the application's API (simulated using local storage in this implementation). It allows components to perform CRUD operations on different data types.

## Contexts

### AuthContext

The `AuthContext` provides authentication state and methods to the entire application. It manages the current user's information and handles login, logout, and registration processes.

### ThemeContext

The `ThemeContext` manages the application's theme, allowing for easy switching between light and dark modes. It provides theme-related values and a toggle function to switch between modes.
